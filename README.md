# Playing-with-some-datasets-to-generate-outcomes
I used Taxi Fare NYC dataset here to generate a lot of outcomes. Basically, the aim here is to take use of an assigned dataset and generate valuable information from it.

Some of the key features used in this work are: 
• Detected outliers using z-score standardization
• Created visualizations using ggplots such as histogram
• Performed Kolmogorov-Smirnof test
• Created new columns
• Created new data set within the dataset
• Split the data into training and test set
• Performed normalization of the data
• Wrote the function for determining the K closest neighbor based on the neighbors through which I can find k.closest value
